      <h3>Goals of confinement and supervision</h3>
      <p>The idea of confining him to an area when not actively playing is so he knows where he stays in home. Dogs do not pee in their homes, so we need to slowly get him used to the house being his home.</p>

      <h3>Trying to tell if he needs to pee</h3>
      <p>If he goes towards the gate to Geo&apos;s, or grabs a leash, or starts smelling around like he is looking for something, or goes away from people: these are all signs he might need to go out. When in doubt take him him out. Going potty indoors gains momentum each time he does it.</p>

      <h3>General Notes</h3>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>When you know he does not have to go potty, make sure he gets some alone time. It is important for him to be used to being alone for a while.</li>
          <li>Watch him all the time to make sure he&apos;s not eating something he&apos;s not supposed to. I caught him outside trying to eat a self-tapping screw <span role="img">ðŸ¤¦</span>
          </li>
          <li>He needs water fairly often. Everytime you fill it add a capful of the teeth cleaner if you remember. Watch for signs of needing to pee after he drinks water!</li>
          <li>If you want to learn new things or do research on your own you can use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ">Zak George on youtube</a> or read one of the books I have left out</li>
          <li>He can&apos;t be in the kitchen/living room unless you&apos; re actively playing with him. My room is okay for him to just be chilling.</li>
          <li>If he gets crazy you can crate him. Generally if you&apos;re near the crate he doesn&apos;t mind.</li>
          <li>So far giving him a bull/buffalo stick has made him to lay down and chew for an hour so maybe can be used in emergency</li>
          <li>He generally likes being around people so if you&apos;re in the kitchen, he might just hang out on the other side of the gate, as long as he can see you he&apos;s happy.</li>
          <li>If he&apos;s doing something you don&apos;t like you can just turn away and not give him attention because attention is what he wants. but he has an attention span of about 2 seconds so you can turn around once he stops and he&apos;ll probably try something else.</li>
          <li>He also apparently likes the crate in my room and goes in there to hang out when I&apos;m sitting on my computer.</li>
        </ul>
